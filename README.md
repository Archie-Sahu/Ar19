🔍 Key Questions Explored:

Which industries have the highest success rates?

Do higher valuations correlate with deal success?

Which shark invests the most (or least)?

How do pitcher demographics (gender, location) impact outcomes?

🛠 Tools Used: Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Jupyter Notebook
📂 Data Source: Kaggle/Shark Tank India Dataset

💡 Why This Matters:
